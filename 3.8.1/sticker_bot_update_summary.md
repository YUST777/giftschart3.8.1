# Sticker Bot Update Summary

## 1. Removed Old MRKT Logic
- Deleted legacy code and references to the old MRKT sticker price system.
- All sticker price data is now sourced from the new API and directory structure.

## 2. Switched to New API/Data Source
- Implemented a script to generate `sticker_price_results.json` directly from the `sticker_collections/` directory.
- Ensured all collections and stickers in the directory are included in the new JSON file.
- Updated the bot to use this new, complete data source for all sticker lookups.

## 3. Fixed Collection and Sticker Placement
- Standardized normalization for collection and sticker names (lowercase, underscores, no special chars).
- Ensured both the generator and the bot use the same normalization logic for file and folder lookups.
- Fixed the bot's lookup so it always finds the correct price card image.

## 4. Added Pagination to Collection Buttons
- Limited the number of collection buttons per page (12 per page, 2 per row).
- Added "← Back" and "Next →" navigation buttons for easy paging.
- Improved the user interface for browsing large numbers of collections.

## 5. Fixed Photo and Caption Sending
- Ensured the bot constructs the correct data structure for captions (`collection`, `sticker`, `price`, `supply`).
- Fixed the fallback logic so the bot always sends or edits messages correctly, even for photo messages.
- Now, pressing a sticker button reliably sends the correct price card image and caption.

**Result:**
- The sticker bot now fully supports all collections and stickers, has a clean and paginated UI, and reliably sends price card images with accurate captions.
